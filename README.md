A basic webserver written entirely in the Turing programming language. Turing is available from [Compsci.ca](http://compsci.ca/holtsoft/).

I recommend v4.1 if you want to use network/internet functions, and v4.1.2 if you want to compile your program into an .exe file that anyone can run. Some network functions may not work properly in v4.1.2. I'm working on it and I'll update this page once everything is happy
